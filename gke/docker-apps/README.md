# Packages

Packages which work like a charm:

    * [RoR] pasta (Pasta/Sauce Matrix for non-Italians)
    * [RoR] ricniftystore (RoR Riccardo templating system: you start from it to develop new things)
    * [PHP] php-app (hello world in PHP)


Package which need additional work, maybe they have a single blessed image working but not automated yet:

    * [RoR] septober-ng
